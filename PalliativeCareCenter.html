        <p align="left" class="paragraph mt20 secondary-color">It is notable that, in Kerala, old aged people are
          higher in number
          in comparison to the younger generation. The responsibility to look after these aged people is with their own
          children. However, due to changing priorities, this is often overlooked.
          Here arises the significance of the Palliative Care Centre and its mission to relieve suffering and to
          improve the quality of life for people of all ages with serious, chronic and life threatening illnesses.
          <br><br>
          Within a year of closing down Asha
          Kiran, Asha Kiran Palliative Care Center was born in the same building in Pothenpuram, Pampady. It was
          inaugurated by Mr. Oomen Chandy, the honorable Chief Minister of Kerala on March 02, 2014. <br><br>Presently
          17
          patients, who are partly disabled
          and bed ridden due to stroke, cancer, paralyzed by spinal cord injuries, old age complaints and other
          ailments, are admitted here. Most of the patients are unable to care for themselves and require full time
          support for their day to day activities.<br><br>
          Four trained nurses look after these patients day and night with a nominal salary. Notable is the
          contribution of a nurse, returned from the Gulf, who is providing her experience as a volunteer service. In
          addition, the inmates of Asha Kiran
          are benefitting from the full time service of Dr. Renjie George, retired Chief Medical Officer from Homoeo
          Hospital, Kurichy, Kottayam, free of charge. Moreover, Mr. Babu Zacharia, a retired teacher, is dedicating
          his valuable time as a full
          time coordinator.<br><br> The daily diet food, various types of medicines, nurse’s care, and hygiene are
          offered with
          no cost to patients. Approximate total monthly expense for these services amounts to ninety thousand to one
          hundred thousand Indian
          Rupees. This institution is presently running with the assistance of our various kind hearted brothers and
          sisters.</p>
