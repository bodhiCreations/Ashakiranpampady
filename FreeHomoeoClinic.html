          <p class="paragraph mt20 secondary-color">The vision of Rev. Fr. Mathew K. John (Mathukutty Achen) for the needy and the poor people of the society had lit the lamp for the starting of a Free Homoe Clinic, as a second phase of the original project of Asha Kiran. He approached the Ashakiran
            Trust and got the necessary approvals for this. Dr. Renjie George, the retired Chief Medical Officer from Kuricy Homoeo Medical College Hospital Kottayam, who has an excellent working experience, agreed to provide his full time service free
            of charge for Asha Kiran. Initial financial help from two faithful servants of Pampady Thirumeni triggered the purchase of various medicines. Mr. K. T. Philipose, a retired NRI, agreed to work as a coordinator. Our respected Chief Minister
            Oommen Chandy inaugurated the Clinic on 30th November, 2014, in the presence of Dr. K. C. Mammen, the Asha Kiran Board member. Mrs. Annamma Cherian, the president of Pampady Grama Panchyat, presided the function. Dr. Hareendran Nair, well
            known member of Pampady, and Dr. M. E. Kuriakose, Principal of K G college, Pampady, grazed the occasion. A large audience from the local community attended the function. The novel idea of a Free Homoe clinic with the intercession of Pampady
            Thirumeni was well appreciated by all felicitators. The timing of the clinic is from 7.30 am till 7.30 p.m. Presently two nurses are also working with the clinic to assist the out patients and in patients. The flow of patients from Pampady
            and its neighboring areas, prior to the Clinic working time, with Asthma, tonsillitis, adenoid, piles, fistulae ,urinary stone, skin disease, white patches, deficiency in studies of school children, have fully proved the acceptance of local
            community of this service of clinic within short time. Friday morning is dedicated to visiting the houses of poor bed ridden patients and to the supply of medicines by the Asha Kiran medical team, comprising of the doctor and nurses. This
            service is also well appreciated by the local community, as patients are getting great relief from the medicine and by the intercessory prayer of our father, Pampady Thirumeni.</p>
