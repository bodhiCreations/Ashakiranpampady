                    Pothenpuram, Pampady, under the Asha Kiran Trust, in 2005, to initially cater to Aids patients and
                    extended to accommodate the children of Aids patients.
                    A trust of five members was constituted to run the Asha Kiran Trust. They were: H G Dr. Mar Mathew
                    Arackal (Chairman), Rev. P.C.Yohannan Ramban (Secretary), Rev. Fr. Mathew Cheruthanickal
                    (Treasurer), Mr. K.C. Dominic and Dr. K.C. Mammen as members. In addition, an advisory board
                    consisting of our Bava Thirumeni, H. B. Philippose Mar Chrisostom Metropolitan, at that time ex- CM
                    Mr. Oommen Chandy, Bishop H. G Sam Mathew, N.S.S Genereal Secreatary Mr. P.K.Narayana Panicker,
                    Orphanage Control Board chairman Mr. Pareekutty Haji and Kottayam District Collector Ms. Rani
                    George was also formed.
                    <br><br>
                    A remarkable building was built with contribution from various Associations and from open hearted
                    people. Though it functioned well for eight years, it had to close down in 2013 due to the expiry
                    of the Agreement with the Government and the reluctance of some of the patients to stay there.
                    On the sudden sad demise of Very Rev. P. C. Yohannan Ramban, the Secretary of Asha Kiran Trust,
                    Rev. Fr. Mathew K. John, (generally known as Mathukutty Achen) was assigned the position of
                    Secretary. In addition to catering to Aids patients, Mathukutty Achen also had a vision to help the
                    needy and the poor people of the society. Thus, with the approval of the Trust, he initiated the
                    transformation of Asha Kiran to Asha Kiran Palliative Care Center, as the first phase and the
                    establishment of the Asha Kiran Free Homoe Clinic, as the second phase.<br><br>“May the above
                    projects grow to be a shelter for many a deserted soul, through the intercessory powers of Pampady
                    Thirumeni.”</p>
